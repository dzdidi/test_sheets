\section{Dependability \cite{lyu}}
Dependability is defined as the trustwothiness of a computer system such that reliance can justifiably be place on the service it delivers. The service delivered by a system is its behaviour as it is perceptible by its users(s); a user is another system (human or physical) iwth the former.\\
Depening on applications inteded for the system, a different emphasis mau be put on the various facets fo dependability, that is dependablility can be veiwed according to different, but complementary properties which enable the attributes of dependability to be defined:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{The readiness for usage} leads to \textbf{availability}
	\item \textit{The continuity of service} leads to \textbf{reliability}
	\item \textit{The nonoccurence of catastrophic consequences on the environment} leads to \textbf{safety}
	\item \textit{The nonoccirence of unauthorized disclosure of information} leads to \textbf{confidentiality}
	\item \textit{The nonoccurrence of improper information} leads to \textbf{integrity}
	\item \textit{The ability to undergo repeairs and evelutions} leads to \textbf{maintainability}
\end{itemize}

\section{Real Time Testing}
"Real-time software is a software thaht dries a computer which intercats  with functioning external devices or objects. It is called real-time because the software actions control activities that are accuring in an ongoing process."\cite{RealTimeTesting}
