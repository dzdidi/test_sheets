While providing of simple way for test description is a hot topic in software development. There is no software developed for a realization of Test Sheet concept, pragmatic way of defining tests which lays between two extreme paradigms FIT and hard coded test definitions. \\

This paper describes processes of design and implementation of the Test Sheets' concept together with integration of the product to business processes of figo GmbH for a real-time testing/validation of internet banking web pages.\\

Result of this research is following: developed conventions for Test Sheets definitions in particular use case, implemented interpreter from Test Sheets to executable JavaScript  code.

Conventions and the code listing of main module together with example of  executable JavaScript file are provided as well as statistics regarding improvement of user experience and overall system fault prevention improvements.


Some feedback from Bianca and Sebastian + statistics regarding user experience improvement

%Implications of this research paper will be helpful for students of computer science disciplines who are interested in combined application of best practices for system design and development from both Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP) approaches. In this paper they will find analysis of suggestions, principles and patterns for design and implementation of scalable and reusable software together with detailed description of the design and implementation process of the Test Sheets paradigm for asyncronous real-time testing.\\ 
%Paper also defines conventions for Test Sheets and indicates test requirements for test implementation and execution.\\
%The design process was made with respect to NodeJS best practices and integral design aspects, design principles and design patterns for OOP together with pipe-and-filter architectural type and application of piping strategies of a FP.\\
%Implementation process described in this paper was performed with following of the Test Driven Development (TDD) rules which guarantees full test coverage together with Clean Code recomendations by Robert C Martin and coding style guide introduced by Airbnb.\\
