 definition (possibly in tabular form)


\begin{itemize}
\item Test Sheets defined by users (clients or employees without development background).
\item Tests themselves will be applied for identification of layout changes on a target page before any interaction will appear to avoid errors and minimize the time of scripts correction.
\end{itemize}
 
\textbf{Execution stages:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Automated transformation of Test Sheets into JavaScript tests;
\item Scheduled task for running tests on web pages;
\item Developer notification regarding failing test.
\end{itemize}

The program run by user 
%The implemented program is running as a crown job which is executing JS files generated from xlsx Test Sheets. Each JS file invokes scrapping script via Command Line Interface which in turn performs communication to Bank's web page. Results of script execution are compared with expected outputs from Test Sheet using a callback function. Result of comparison is written to LogStash and original Test Sheet.
