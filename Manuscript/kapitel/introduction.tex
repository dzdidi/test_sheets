Relevance of the topic and the necessity for scientific investigation: No researches found regarding semi automated tests generation for web page verification.\\
Practical and theoretical value of the topic: Implementation of enginee for Test Sheets with application of software design and development practices.\\
Motives for choosing a particular topic:  Necessity of tests defined by non-developers for figo for a real-time testing (will be provided later)\\
Research problem and why it is worthwhile studying - definition of convention for test sheets definition, usage of test sheets for testing of asynchromous systems in a real-time.\\
Research objectives - design and development of software for translation of test sheets in to executable java script for testing asyncronous calls to external system.\\

%Research methodology : available research methods, choice of methods, rationale behind the selected selected methods , data sources, research design, data collection instruments and measures to ensure validity and reliability of information, and analytical techniques
