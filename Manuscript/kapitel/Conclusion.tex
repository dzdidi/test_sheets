The software product developed during the Test Sheet project in figo GmbH is a prove of concept for use of the Test Sheet approach for asynchronous testing of real-time systems.


The callback pattern for handling asynchronous events together with code generation optimization which allows to call independent test steps within the same iteration of an event loop makes it possible to run the tests on a timely basis. 

The design and architecture of the system makes it easy to enhance and change. While application of test driven development approach provides control over the code.

Conventions developed for this project expand the original Test Sheets approach with an opportunity to perform two type of comparison for test steps results.

User experience collected during the pilot stage of the project shows that Test Sheets is comfortable and convenient approach to define test for people with little or without software development background.

Analysis of misfits and benefits of the system's use indicates the practical applicability of the Test Sheets approach for asynchronous testing of the real-time software systems.
