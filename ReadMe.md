 ##Planned Use Case
 Test Sheets defined by users (clients or employees without development background) will be used for real-time testing of banking web page scraping scripts. Tests themselves will be applied for identification of layout changes on a target page before any interaction will appear to avoid errors and minimize the time of scripts correction.

Execution stages:
 - Automated transformation of Test Sheets into JavaScript tests;
 - Scheduled task for running tests on web pages;
 - Developer notification.
